## Notes
### EDA
- tSNE and PCA didn't work on SDF clusters
- ToDo: research about pyvista's SDF
- working solution: pointcloud density, define t-test?
### SDF
- pyvista SDF gives nonsense
  - SDF is OK and fast! was bug in my code
- ToDO: check out trimesh, IGL
  - unnecessary
 ### ToDo
 - filter outliers
 - train DeepSDF
 - try out voxelization
